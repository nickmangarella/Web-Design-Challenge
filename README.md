Use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a dashboard of the cities.csv and OpenWeatherMap API analysis.

### Website - Latitude

* Landing Page:
    * Explanation of the project
    * Sidebar with images of each visualization that links to their respective page

* Four Visualizations Pages:
    * The visualization for the selected plot
    * A paragraph describing the visual and the analysis
    * Sidebar with images of each visualization that links to their respective page

* Comparisons Page:
    * All of the visualizaitons so they can be easily compared
    * A Bootstrap grid is used for the visualizations that must be two visualizations across on screens medium and large and 1 across on extra-small and small screens

* Data Page:
    * Displays a Bootstrap responsive table of the cities.csv dataset that was used in the visualizations and analyses
    * The csv was exported as an HTML table from a DataFrame using Pandas

* Each webpage:
    * Has a navbar with the name of the site that links to the landing page
    * A dropdown navigation menu called 'Plots' with links to each visualization page
    * Two text links 'Comparisons' and 'Data' that link to their corresponding pages
    * Is responsive using media queries that adjust the navbar and sidebar depending on screen size
